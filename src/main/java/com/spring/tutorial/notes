Earlier Notes:

If the injection point is not annotated with @Qualifier, it will ignore all @Qualifier placed at the class level
and will not try to use the qualifier name to resolve a conflict

@Component annotation is used for defining bean definition
@Qualifier annotation is used to resolve ambiguity in choosing a bean candidate in the case of a conflict

@Resources is used for a special kind of combinatorial key.By using the @Resource, we can indicate the exact bean
definition name that we seek by combining the type and unique bean definition name. A short coming is that It cannot
be used with constructors at injection point. However, it can only be used on fields and setter methods with only one
parameter.

## @Named & @ManagedBean Like @Component & @Qualifier ##
These are extra annotations from JSRs and not from Spring. However, Spring still recognizes them. e.g.
1. @ManagedBean: this functions exactly as the @Component annotation.
2. @Named: this also functions exactly as the @Component annotation. It can be used on top of a class and at the
injection point to help spring select between bean definitions.
