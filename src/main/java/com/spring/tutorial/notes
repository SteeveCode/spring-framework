The ApplicationContext interface is responsible for everything about the IOC container and dependency injection. One
of its responsibility is gathering all the bean definitions from all the sources of all the configurations.
It can be configured with: XML, Annotation Config or Java Based Config.

If the injection point is not annotated with @Qualifier, it will ignore all @Qualifier placed at the class level
and will not try to use the qualifier name to resolve a conflict

## @Component
This annotation is used for defining bean definition & configuration
## @Qualifier
This annotation is used to resolve ambiguity in choosing a bean candidate in the case of a conflict

## @Resources
This is used for a special kind of combinatorial key.By using the @Resource, we can indicate the exact bean
definition name that we seek by combining the type and unique bean definition name. A short coming is that It cannot
be used with constructors at injection point. However, it can only be used on fields and setter methods with only one
parameter.

## @Named & @ManagedBean Like @Component & @Qualifier
These are extra annotations from JSRs and not from Spring. However, Spring still recognizes them. e.g.
1. @ManagedBean: this functions exactly as the @Component annotation.
2. @Named: this also functions exactly as the @Component annotation. It can be used on top of a class and at the
injection point to help spring select between bean definitions.

## @Conditional
This is used to determine if a bean definition should be added into the list of bean definition or not
under certain conditions. However, the @Conditional annotation is not used directly when defining a bean definition. It
serves as a meta annotation to another meta annotated annotation which is used instead i.e @Profile. It is @Profile
that is actual used. The idea of @Profile("") is that we will pass in some string that will indicate the condition that
must be satisfied before the bean is activated. A typical example is in say a test environment or if the app runs in an
environment with limited resources such as memory.Activating a profile does not have anything to do with bean definitions
that does not have a profile set. Beans with no profiles always gets added to the bean definition list. To activate a
profile, the code below must be used in the main class
to create the IOC container(application context).

 var di = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
        di.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("test");
        di.scan("com.spring.tutorial");
        di.refresh();

 ## BeanPostProcessor
 If you wish to extend the behaviour of the application context, you don't need to override or extend the
 ApplicationContext class itself. The ApplicationContext provides a bunch of hooks, callbacks that you can to do that.
 The most important way of extending the ApplicationContext behaviour is to use an interface names BeanPostProcessor.
 The BeanPostProcessor allows us to provide custom logic before and after each bean is instantiated, configured &
 initialized. The way to register a BeanPostProcessor is by creating a class that extends BeanPostProcessor a placing
 the @Component annotation on top of it.

 Note:
 The BeanPostProcessor is typically used by developers that build frameworks with the aim to extend the spring framework.

 ## Hash Code Method
 The hashCode() method, typically used in the toString() returns the memory address of an object

 ## PreConstruct & PostDestroy Bean Life Cycle
 A object goes through multiple phases and cycles throughout the life time of its scope. The first phase or cycle an
 object experiences is the construction phase. However, there are times that object instance are not capable of being
 fully constructed at the time of calling the constructor. One of the things that the IOC does besides calling the
 constructor method during the life cycle of a bean is that it can introduce extra life cycle related functions that will
 be called when all the field dependencies have been injected. Typical examples of these methods are @PostConstruct &
 @PreDestroy.

## AutoClosable / Closable Interface
Another way of introducing destruction point in the life cycle of an object is to make the class implement either the
AutoClosable or Closable interface and then override the close() with custom logic. It is safe to implement the
AutoClosable or Closable interface because they are from the Java JDK and does not couple your code to the framework.
Implementing an interface from the spring framework is not recommended.

## @DependsOn
This is used for specifying the order of initialization and destruction of a bean. The annotation ensure that the
dependencies are initialized first, and then the dependent. When the bean is being destroyed, the order is reversed.
If an order is not set using this annotation, the application context will be responsible for choosing an order at
random in which to initialize the beans .
